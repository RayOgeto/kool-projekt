## Ujamaaflow

## Introduction

Ujamaaflow is a web application that is designed to link resource donors with individuals and families in need.
The platform streamlines the donation process, making it easy for donors to offer items such as food, clothing, devices and equipment and for recipients to request the resources they need. 
Inspired by the spirit of "Ujamaa" (community, cooperation and familyhood), Ujamaaflow fosters a sense of togetherness and support which flows within the local communities, making it easily accessible to everyone in need (hence the flow part).

## Key Features

- **User Roles:** Donors, recipients and admins each have tailored dashboards and permissions.
- **Easy Donations:** Donors can quickly list items they wish to donate, add images and their location for quality control and a pickup option.
- **Resource Requests:** Recipients can submit requests for specific resources and a reason for the request.
- **Matching System:** Admins can view and match donations to requests.
- **Secure Authentication:** User accounts and role-based access control.

## How it works?

Glad you asked :). 
1. **Donors** register and list available resources.
2. **Recipients** register and submit requests for needed items.
3. **Admins** review and match donations to requests, ensuring resources reach those who need them most.
